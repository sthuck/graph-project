graph-project
=============

Done as a student project, implementing a sparse spanner generating graph as described here - http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~elkinm/teaching/embed_proj/autumn10/Althofer.pdf. 

As a byproduct, this project also has implementation of some other basic graph-related algorithms such as: BFS, Dijkstra shortest path, and Floyd-Warshall all shortest paths.

Also has a very basic graphml file import ability. (probably only comptaible with graphs genertated by yED).
